# About the Extension
<img src="http://chieffancypants.github.com/NamespacePollution/ns-pollution.png">

View the total namespace pollution at a glance!  This can be useful when assessing your own sites and apps, and for educating your developers on the potential harm of a heavily polluted namespace.  I have particularly found it useful when reverse engineering other sites.

## Installation
First, you'll need to clone this repo:

```git clone git://github.com/chieffancypants/NamespacePollution.git```

To install in chrome, go to the extensions panel (chrome://settings/extensions) and click the "Load unpacked extension' and provide it with the directory you just cloned.
